One of my project for Data Structure 2nd Semester. The project is a simple library CRUD app with name *"Cornelius Library"*

The project implements various of data structure concepts, such as :
1. Recursion (used in multiple functions for efficient problem-solving)           
2. Sorting (use Quick Sort to sort the book titles)         
3. Searching (use Binary Search to search a book title)
4. Tree (used to store and manage book data )         
5. Graph (give reading suggestions based on book that has been borrowed)
6. Hash Table and Collision Handling (to manage book loans)

The project is developed using Functional programming, C++ language, runs on CLI, and only requires iostream

There is a [report](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18434627/Dokumentasi_085_Cornelius_Praktikum.docx)
written in *Bahasa Indonesia* that you can read from.
